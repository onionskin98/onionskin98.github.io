You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

<div><canvas id=myCanvas></canvas></div>

<script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/test.js" ></script>

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight hlsl %}
float3 x = 5;
if(x > 5)
{
  return;
}
print_hi('Tom')
// This is a comment
{% endhighlight %}
